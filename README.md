# About Me

My name is Shaurya, and I'm a business graduate from D.Y Patil University with a marketing major. I've always been interested in the IT industry, but I wasn't sure how to get started or what roles I would be good at. In my final semester, I discovered analytics and started learning Excel, including its advanced functions. I also experimented with various visualization tools like PowerBi, Tableau, and Looker Studio to see what worked best. Along the way, I also gained proficiency in MySQL and learned how to write effective queries.
